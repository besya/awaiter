# Awaiter
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/awaiter.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/awaiter)

Using ruby Threads as async/await

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'awaiter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install awaiter

## Usage

```ruby
require 'awaiter'

class MyClass
  include Awaiter
  async :first, :second
  
  def first
    p 'First stared'
    sleep(1)
    p 'First finished'
    'first result'
  end
  
  def second
    p 'Second stared'
    sleep(1)
    first_result = await first
    p 'Second finished'
    'second result with ' + first_result
  end
end
  

my = MyClass.new

p await my.first
# "First stared"
# "First finished"
# "first result"

p await my.second
# "Second stared"
# "First stared"
# "First finished"
# "Second finished"
# "second result with first result"


```

```ruby
require 'awaiter'

class MyClass
  include Awaiter
  async :first
  
  def first
    p 'First stared'
    sleep(2)
    p 'First finished'
    'first result'
  end  
end
  

my = MyClass.new
t1 = my.first
sleep(1)
p 'Main thread'
r1 = await t1
p r1

# "First stared"
# "Main thread"
# "First finished"
# "first result"

```

```ruby
require 'awaiter'

class MyClass
  include Awaiter
  async :first, :second
  
  def first
    sleep(4)
    'first result'
  end  

  def second
    sleep(2)
    'second result'
  end  
end

my = MyClass.new

r1, r2 = wait(my.first, my.second)

p r1
p r2

# "first result"
# "second result"

```

## Example

### Without threads

```ruby
require 'open-uri'

class Downloader
  def download(name, url)
    open('./files/' + name, 'wb') do |file|
      file << open(url).read
    end
  end
end

file_url = 'http://www.sample-videos.com/audio/mp3/crowd-cheering.mp3'

downloader = Downloader.new

start = Time.now

f1 = downloader.download('1.mp3', file_url)
f2 = downloader.download('2.mp3', file_url)
f3 = downloader.download('3.mp3', file_url)
f4 = downloader.download('4.mp3', file_url)
f5 = downloader.download('5.mp3', file_url)

finish = Time.now

p finish - start
# 17.071239374

```

### Using threads

```ruby
require 'awaiter'
require 'open-uri'

class Downloader
  include Awaiter
  async :download

  def download(name, url)
    open('./files/' + name, 'wb') do |file|
      file << open(url).read
    end
  end
end

file_url = 'http://www.sample-videos.com/audio/mp3/crowd-cheering.mp3'

downloader = Downloader.new

start = Time.now

f1 = downloader.download('1.mp3', file_url)
f2 = downloader.download('2.mp3', file_url)
f3 = downloader.download('3.mp3', file_url)
f4 = downloader.download('4.mp3', file_url)
f5 = downloader.download('5.mp3', file_url)

wait f1, f2, f3, f4, f5

finish = Time.now

p finish - start
# 3.379413503

```

## How it works

When you use ```async :method``` your method will be wrapped in Thread.new. 
Calling of ```method``` returns this thread. 
Usage of ```await method``` is waiting for the thread was done and returns the result of work.  
The ```await method``` is just equivalent of ```method.join.value```. 
Usage of ```wait method1, method2``` will wait when both methods were finished and will return array of results. 
You can use ```result1, result2 = wait method1, method2``` for getting results from async methods. 
The ```wait f1, f2, f3``` it's just equivalent of ```[f1.join.value, f2.join.value, f3.join.value]```


### With Awaiter
```ruby
require 'awaiter'

class MyClass
  include Awaiter
  async :first, :second

  def first
    'first result'
  end

  def second
    first_result = await first
    'second result with ' + first_result
  end
end

my = MyClass.new

p await my.first
# "first result"

p wait my.first, my.second
# ["first result", "second result with first result"]
```

### Equivalent without using Awaiter
```ruby
class MyClass
  def first
    Thread.new do
      'first result'
    end
  end

  def second
    Thread.new do
      first_result = first.join.value
      'second result with ' + first_result
    end
  end
end

my = MyClass.new

p my.first.join.value
# "first result"

p [my.first.join.value, my.second.join.value]
# ["first result", "second result with first result"]
```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
