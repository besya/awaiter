## Usage

```ruby
require 'awaiter'

class MyClass
  include Awaiter
  async :first, :second
  
  def first
    p 'First stared'
    sleep(1)
    p 'First finished'
    'first result'
  end
  
  def second
    p 'Second stared'
    sleep(1)
    first_result = await first
    p 'Second finished'
    'second result with ' + first_result
  end
end
  

my = MyClass.new

p await my.first
# "First stared"
# "First finished"
# "first result"

p await my.second
# "Second stared"
# "First stared"
# "First finished"
# "Second finished"
# "second result with first result"


```

```ruby
require 'awaiter'

class MyClass
  include Awaiter
  async :first
  
  def first
    p 'First stared'
    sleep(2)
    p 'First finished'
    'first result'
  end  
end
  

my = MyClass.new
t1 = my.first
sleep(1)
p 'Main thread'
r1 = await t1
p r1

# "First stared"
# "Main thread"
# "First finished"
# "first result"

```

```ruby
require 'awaiter'

class MyClass
  include Awaiter
  async :first, :second
  
  def first
    sleep(4)
    'first result'
  end  

  def second
    sleep(2)
    'second result'
  end  
end

my = MyClass.new

r1, r2 = wait(my.first, my.second)

p r1
p r2

# "first result"
# "second result"


```
